# Getting started

## Setting up Rust

We recommend using [rustup][ru] to easily install the latest stable version of rust.
Instructions should be on the screen once rustup is downloaded.

[ru]: https://rustup.rs

> **Updating Rust:** If you already have Rust installed, make sure you're using the
  the latest version by running `rustup update`.

We recommend using the stable version of Rust, as Rust nightlies tend to break rather
often.

> **Using the stable toolchain:** Rustup can be configured to default to the stable
  toolchain by running `rustup default stable`.
